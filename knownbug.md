even if I refresh cache, errors stay in the form.
'email is required' and 'emails not matching' if error = filter validate email false
login =
if($doesUserExists && $isPasswordMatching) 
works for username but I can put whatever password it still connects me

if on profile then logout, but go back, it still redirects me to profile with undefined index (seems to be fixed)
