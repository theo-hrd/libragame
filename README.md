# LibraGame



## What is LibraGame ?

LibraGame is a PHP / JavaScript / HTML / CSS web application using the MVC design pattern.



## What is the purpose of this web application ?

LibraGame's purpose is to give users the possibility to get information about games from the RAWG Rest API (videogame API). 



## Front End: 

I used JavaScript, with some AJAX (first time that I used it) for the API requests, with a pagination going through all the API requests.

The games are classified by genre, clickable on the buttons and fetched using AJAX on the 'browse games' page.
